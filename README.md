[CHECKOUT OUR DEMO HERE](https://brainfuel.up.railway.app/)

## Problems
* Typed note taking encouraged passive learning patterns
  * Students just regurgitate the professor's words
  * Review for exams by only passively re-reading notes
* Fragmentation of tooling
  * Context-switching mental overhead to switch between apps
  * Time-consuming to port content from one app to another

→ What if our learning process can be more engaging (and effective) by making the notes more interactive?

You take your notes like normal, and then with a few small markup words, we transform your notes interactive partner to help you actively enhance higher-order learning
